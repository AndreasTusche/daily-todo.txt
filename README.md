daily-todo.txt
==============

todo.txt sorted once a day puts most important tasks to the top

WARNING
=======

1) All paths are hard-coded! Before using the script you need to modify the source code unless yu're using the same paths. A business-related `todo.txt` file is expected at `~/Dropbox/todo.txt`, another private stuff related file is expected at `~/Dropbox/todo_priv.txt`.

2) It was designed to run in the MobaXterm Personal Edition v7.2 under Windows 7. It may not run elsewhere without modifications.


Prerequisites
=============

You will need to have GNU awk (gawk) installed on your system. You may ask Google for an existing binary. For Mac OS X there's a good instruction available by [Hong Xu](http://www.topbug.net/blog/2013/04/14/install-and-use-gnu-command-line-tools-in-mac-os-x/).
